### Hi there 👋

👨‍💻 I'm David, a software engineer specializing in TypeScript, React, and Node! 

🔧 I've built a couple cool projects, including a [visualizer for React application component and state heirarchy](https://github.com/React-Sight/React-Sight), a demo of the [HTML5 gamepad API](https://gamepad-nu.now.sh/), and a [server for controlling my Denon AVR](https://github.com/davidcsally/restful-denon)

📝 Occasionally I write articles and how to posts, such as:

- [Accessibility patterns all front-end developers should know](https://uxdesign.cc/accessibility-patterns-all-front-end-developers-should-know-b5d705c42b4c)
- [Upgrading our build system to Webpack4](https://medium.com/@davidchristophersally/upgrading-our-build-system-to-webpack4-6b13dd58721a)
